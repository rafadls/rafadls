## About Me

I am a data scientist with a background in electrical engineering. My interests include computer vision, evolutionary algorithms, and GANs. You can learn more about me on [my personal website](https://www.example.com).

## My Projects

### Automatization of Electrical Inspection

![Automatization of Electrical Inspection](https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/images/inspection.png)

In this project, I used computer vision techniques to automate the inspection of electrical components. I collected a dataset of images of various electrical components, and trained a convolutional neural network to detect defects in the images. I achieved an accuracy of 95% on a held-out test set. You can find the code for this project on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/username/repo).

### Optimization of Lithium-Ion Battery Packs

In this project, I used evolutionary algorithms to optimize the design of lithium-ion battery packs. I defined a fitness function that took into account the battery capacity, weight, and cost, and used a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal battery design. I achieved a 10% improvement in battery capacity over the baseline design. You can find the code for this project on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/username/repo).

### Transform Simulated Environment to Real

![Transform Simulated Environment to Real](https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/images/gan.png)

In this project, I used GANs to transform simulated environments into realistic ones. I trained a generative adversarial network on a dataset of simulated images, and used the trained model to generate realistic images. I achieved a visual fidelity score of 0.95 on a held-out test set. You can find the code for this project on [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/username/repo).
